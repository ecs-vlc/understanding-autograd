    "# Reverse Mode Automatic Differentiation with PyTorch\n",

    "PyTorch implements Dynamic Reverse Mode Automatic Differentiation, much like we did in the previous exercise. There is one really major difference in what PyTorch provides over our simple example: it works directly with matrices (`Tensor`s) rather than with scalars (although obviously a matrix can represent a scalar).\n",

Note that we're using the API of PyTorch 0.4 or later which simplifies use of AD (previous versions required wrapping all `Tensor`s that you wanted to compute gradients of in `Variable` objects; PyTorch 0.4 removes the need to do this and allows `Tensor`s themselves to track gradients).\n",
